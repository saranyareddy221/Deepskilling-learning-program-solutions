Summary:
---------
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for object-relational mapping in Java.
Hibernate is a popular implementation of JPA and also provides additional features.
Spring Data JPA is an abstraction layer on top of JPA (typically using Hibernate) to reduce boilerplate code.

Use Spring Data JPA when you want rapid development and less boilerplate.
Use Hibernate directly if you need fine-tuned control over ORM operations.
